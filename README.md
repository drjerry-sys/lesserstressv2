## Introduction
- lesserStress itself is the name of a project purposely launched for the purpose of solving accommodation issues on Obafemi Awolowo University campus. The app's real name is to be Void.
- The Idea came when the author wasn't fully versed with writting react js, with constant practise and 'learning while building' the project has moved from its immatured version 1 to this version with great interface.
- It solves the major challenge for students who struggles to get an agent when there's need for them to relocate. This will serve as a platform where agent meets their potential customers and customers easily meets an agent.

## Fearures
- platform for agents
  - This comprises of a form for agents to register their property
  - A payment system where monentary transactions can be made to the agent
- Authentication System
  - All users, whether agents or customers register themselves before performing any transaction. Visitors can only view and search for accomodation.
