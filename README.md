## Introduction
- lesserStress itself is the name of a project purposely launched for the purpose of solving accommodation issues on Obafemi Awolowo University campus.
- The Idea came when the author wasn't fully versed with writting react js, with constant practise and 'learning while building' the project has moved from its immatured version 1 to this version with great interface.
